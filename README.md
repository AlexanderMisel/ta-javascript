# ta-javascript

Textadept is an amazing text editor for minimalist programmers, while its community is rather small. As I found no available JavaScript modules for it, I wrote one base [an old one by Brian Schott](https://bitbucket.org/SirAlaran/ta-javascript). I'm very thankful for his tags file which helped me a lot on writing a new JavaScript module.

As a front-end coder, I strongly recommend you to download the official HTML and CSS modules from [here](https://foicica.com/textadept/download/textadept_LATEST.modules.zip).
